\f0\fs24 \cf0 	The SetStuff class consists of a number of methods that are used to modify, combine, and analyze sets. The methods were taken from code produced in a codingbat, and modified to fit an actual class. It fulfills all the specifications because all of the methods accurately apply their desired outcomes, and no large errors have been found. The code structure is really just a mishmash of the different methods, each one independent of the others.}
